    Convert time into date object and store it into new variable date.
    Convert the date object’s contents into a string using date.toString() function
    Example 1: This example first gets the milliseconds of the current date and time, Then using that value to get the date by Date() method.

    edit
    play_arrow

    brightness_4

  <p>Final Project
    Objectives
    • Gain experience with designing and implementing a web application with Python and JavaScript.
    Overview
    The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your website will be entirely up to you, albeit subject to the below
    requirements.
    Requirements
    In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:
    • Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course, and more complex than those.
    • Your web application must utilize at least two of Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
    • Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
    • In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created or modified, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
    • If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to requirements.txt!
    Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to you!
    How to Submit
    IMPORTANT: On 1 July 2020, CS50W will update to a new version and this version of this project will no longer be accepted for credit. If you haven’t completed the entire course by that date, that’s okay! If you ultimately receive a passing grade
    on this project, we will consider it equivalent in scope and content to the Final Project in the new version of the course, and within two weeks after 1 July 2020 your gradebook at https://cs50.me/cs50w will update to reflect that you have
    received credit for having completed the Final Project.
    1. If you haven’t already done so, visit this link, log in with your GitHub account, and click Authorize cs50. Then, check the box indicating that you’d like to grant course staff access to your submissions, and click Join course.
    2. If you’ve installed submit50, execute
    3. submit50 web50/projects/2020/x/final
    Otherwise, using Git, push your work to https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git, where USERNAME is your GitHub username, on a branch called web50/projects/2020/x/final.
    4. Record a 1- to 5-minute screencast in which you demonstrate your app’s functionality and/or walk viewers through your code. Upload that video to YouTube (as unlisted or public, but not private) or somewhere else.
    5. Submit this form.
    You can then go to https://cs50.me/cs50w to view your progress!

    Project 0: Homepage
    Objectives
    • Become more comfortable with HTML and CSS to design and style webpages.
    • Learn to use SCSS to write more complex stylesheets for your webpages.
    Getting Started
    Your First Webpage
    Download the distro code for this project from https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.zip and unzip project0.zip, which should yield a directory called project0.
    Then, in a terminal window (located in /Applications/Utilities on Mac or by typing cmd in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted project0 (recall that the cd command can change your current directory), and run
    cd project0
    to enter the project directory. Now, run
    touch index.html
    to create a new index.html file in your repository. Open the file with your favorite text editor: popular choices include Atom, Sublime Text, and VS Code. Then, paste in the following contents:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

    <head>
      <title>My Webpage</title>
    </head>

    <body>
      Hello, world!
    </body>

    </html>
    Then, save your index.html file.
    Requirements
    Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to
    the following requirements:
    • Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
    • Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
    • Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
    • Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
    • Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
    • You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
    • Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
    • In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
    Note that not all of the above requirements are covered in Lecture 0, some will be introduced in Lecture 1.
